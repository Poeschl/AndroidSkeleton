This is the stub for my Android Apps. It will be updated with time (hopefully).

Included features:
------------------
+ Local keystore support (the keystore and the credentials are not checked in)
+ checkstyle execution on release builds with own checkstyle config
+ git Hash and build time available via BuildConfig
